You can use this software for your own purposes 

## Best for Python 3.6+ developers who are learning python.
### You can use it as your own project. This one is way to basic. If i had time i would make it much more advanced with MongoDB and MySql Connectivity + Use TKinter and Flask for GUI and Web Support to make this project more pleasing. Lastly One more suggestion You can Obviously use Data Analysis for better result.

"All Yours to make only waiting on you to innovate"
